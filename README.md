# Clojure

## Approach to problem solving
- break tasks into parts
- test each Function
- repeat until results match expectations

- incremental
- exploratory
- data-centric

- Build up state, run code, re-run until get it right
- change logic at runtime

## Debugging
- bottom up Approach
- Identity problem area
- List of suspects
- exercise each function with sample data
